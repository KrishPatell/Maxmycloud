### Critical Issues:

1. ❌ **Testimonials Section:** Still visible on site - **SHOULD BE HIDDEN** (Raj said "Let's hide this for now as we don't have any customers")

2. ❌ **H1 Header Text:** Still shows "Preferred by top brands across the globe" - **NEEDS TO BE REPLACED** (Raj said to replace this text)

3. ❌ **Pricing - Most Popular Badge:** Both Professional AND Enterprise show "🔥Most popular" - **ONLY ENTERPRISE should have it** (Raj said Enterprise is most popular)

4. ❌ **Testimonial - Carlos Jonson:** Still shows "Carlos Jonson" - **SHOULD BE "Carla"** (female picture) with quote "I can't imagine running my business without it!"

5. ❌ **Testimonial - Lisa W:** Shows "Lisa W" - **SHOULD BE "Director"** (not "Entrepreneur")
